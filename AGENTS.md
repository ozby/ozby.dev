# Operating Contract

Prefer repo-local instructions when more specific.
Keep changes small.

## Setup after clone

```bash
vp install && vp run setup:agent && wp sync  # setup and sync are separate, idempotent steps
```

agent-kit's catalog is the single source of truth for generated agent surfaces.
Agent-kit owns generated agent surfaces here; Webpresso CLI owns the end-user command surface.

- Optional agent tools can be WP-owned with `wp install codex|claude-code|opencode` or `wp install oh-my opencode`; `openagent` aliases the latter, and WP-owned scopes use `wp update`.
- `wp setup` repairs the managed `.gitignore` block for regenerated surfaces.
- Consumer repos use global `wp`, keep only `@webpresso/agent-config` locally, and do not add local `@webpresso/agent-kit`.
- Track repo-owned instruction sources (`AGENTS.md`, `agent-rules/`, `agent-skills/`); ignore generated/runtime surfaces (`.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, etc.).

- Keep the generated default `AGENTS.md` under 8 KB.
- Move handbook prose to docs; keep only durable rules here.

## Plan

Use blueprints for non-trivial work. Specs live in
[`blueprints/`](./blueprints/) with lifecycle directories such as
`planned/`, `in-progress/`, and `completed/`. Keep tasks, dependencies,
verification commands, and acceptance criteria current before execution.

For non-trivial changes, run repo lifecycle tooling before edits. Single
blueprint: `./bin/wp blueprint start <slug>` creates/binds its owner worktree;
do not pre-create `wp worktree new bp/<slug>`. Never edit on `main`. PRs are
for review/landing. Non-`*.md` PRs need a changed blueprint unless
`Blueprint-exempt: <reason>` or Dependabot dependency-only. Full rule:
`.agent/rules/pre-implementation.md` § Blueprint gate.

Ultragoal: never use main as controller. Use `./bin/wp worktree new
bp/ultragoal-<slug> --base origin/main`; run `./bin/wp blueprint start
<slug>` there. After merge run `./bin/wp worktree merge-cleanup
<merged-worktree> --base origin/main` (or `--stash-primary` if primary is
dirty); do not claim done while the
merged worktree remains.

Catalog-owned surfaces:

- `.agent/commands/` — slash-command sources
- `.agent/skills/` — generated/projected skills; edit the catalog, not generated copies

## Implement

- Prefer repo scripts/wrappers over ad-hoc commands.
- Repo hook/tool denial: switch to the named facade/lifecycle; do not retry raw.
- Reuse nearby utilities and patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Apply DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, and KISS.
- No hardcoded relative paths in executable code or config; derive from an explicit absolute anchor.

Hook invariant: global hooks use the canonical contract; skill hooks never
project into host settings. Bound hot paths; do not raise timeouts or hide work
asynchronously.

## Verify

Before claiming completion, run the narrowest checks that prove the change:

- agent-kit MCP tools first when available; otherwise the repo wrapper
- typecheck
- lint / format check
- affected tests
- repo policy checks such as `verify:paths` / `verify:secrets`
- docs or blueprint validation when docs/plans changed
- `wp sync --check` after template/catalog changes

If a gate fails, fix root cause or record the blocker with evidence.

## Communicate

Explain why the change exists, tradeoffs, and what was verified.
Before opening/updating a PR, prefill `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
AI/model disclosure (`Execution model(s)`, `Planning/refinement model(s)`,
`Review/verification model(s)`, `Review artifact/verdict`, `Session id` via
`wp session-info`) or add `Review-skip: SKIP <specific reason>` /
`Session-skip: SKIP <reason>`; the PR description contract enforces this.
Record durable architecture decisions in the repo's ADR/planning surface if one exists.

## Repo-specific customizations

Command routing is a hard invariant: prefer `wp`, then `vp`, then `pnpm`.
Use `vp` only when `wp` has no equivalent, and raw `pnpm` only when neither
facade can perform the operation. All documentation, instructions, scripts,
and workflow examples must follow this hierarchy without exception.

## Safety boundaries

- Do not commit secrets or credentials.
- Do not persist secret files (`.env*`, `.dev.vars*`).
- Use `wp secrets doctor`/`wp secrets run` for secret-scoped commands.
- Keep secret/path checks on shared audit surfaces when available.
- Do not commit agent surfaces (`.agent/`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`).
- Do not hand-edit generated or derived surfaces; edit the catalog in agent-kit.
- Do not push directly to `main`; use PRs and keep CI green.
- Do not bypass hooks or verification gates.
- Treat publishable tarballs as public disclosure surfaces.
- Surface conflicts between this file and deeper repo instructions instead of silently ignoring either.

## Durable planning surface

- Materialized by setup: blueprint lifecycle directories under `blueprints/`.
- Put blueprint-owned PRDs and test specs under `blueprints/`, next to the blueprint they refine.
- Generated on demand (not created by setup): boundary contracts at `.agent/planning/contracts/`, lifecycle state at `.agent/planning/state/`, session notes at `.agent/planning/notepad.md`, and project memory at `.agent/planning/project-memory.json`.

If work changes workspace ownership, build boundaries, or cross-package consumption mode, update the relevant boundary contract before claiming the plan is ready.

## Releases

Packages use **Changesets**. Release-visible changes need `.changeset/*.md`; non-release needs `Changeset-exempt: <reason>`. Default patch. Never minor/major without explicit user request; ask if warranted. Never tag or bump versions.

Flow: changeset → commit → merge; Version PR uses `release.yml` only. Never local publish; `npm view` is registry evidence.

```bash
vp run changeset:status
```

Protocol: `.agent/rules/changeset-release.md`

## Package conventions

- No `../` parent-relative imports — use workspace deps + subpath exports.
- No `.mjs` source files — write `.ts`.
- Use `vp` as the command facade; no `npm install`/`npx` setup guidance.
- All packages: `"type": "module"`, public npm `publishConfig`.
- Publishing: `release.yml`/OIDC only; no local publish or token fallbacks.
